The ft_printf project involves creating your own version of the standard printf function in C. The goal is to implement a formatted output function that can handle various data types and formatting options, such as integers, strings, characters, and floating-point numbers. Throughout the project, you will learn how to manage variable arguments using va_list, va_start, and va_end, as well as how to parse and interpret format specifiers. By the end of the project, you'll have a deeper understanding of formatting strings, managing memory efficiently, and handling variable argument functions in C, all while developing a highly customizable and reusable function for formatted output.
